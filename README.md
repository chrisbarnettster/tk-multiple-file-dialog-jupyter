Upload multiple file dialog in jupyter notebooks


# Run on binder

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/chrisbarnettster/tk-multiple-file-dialog-jupyter)

A Binder-compatible repo with a `requirements.txt` file.

The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that your notebooks depend on, and they will be installed using 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note that many scientific Python libraries (e.g. `numpy`, `scipy`, `sklearn`, etc.) are included already because the [`base`](https://github.com/binder-project/binder-build-core/blob/master/images/base/Dockerfile) image for Binder is built on Anaconda.

In this example we include the library `tk`.
